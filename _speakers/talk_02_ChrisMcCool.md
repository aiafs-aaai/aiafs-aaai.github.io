<!-- **Artificial Intelligence for agricultural digital twins**  -->
 
<!-- Digital Twins is a novel paradigm that provides previously unheard levels of control over physical entities and help to manage complex systems by integrating an array of technologies, including artificial intelligence, big data and internet of things. Digital Twins in agriculture are still emerging. This talk sketches the state of the art of digital twins in the agricultural sector, and presents some of our experiences in using AI for deploying for operational decision support in agricultural systems. -->
