<!-- **Multi-modality Remote Sensing + Machine Learning in High Throughput Phenotyping of Row Crops**   -->

<!-- High-throughput phenotyping using high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution
remote sensing (RS) data has become a critical part of the plant breeding chain focused on
reducing the time and cost of the selection process for the “best” genotypes with respect to the
trait(s) of interest. In this presentation, we investigate the potential of high resolution RGB,
visible and near infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral data, as well as
light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data acquired from UAV platforms for predicting
characteristics of sorghum and maize. In addition to direct measurements of traditional
phenotypes, these sensors potentially provide surrogate measurements for more complex plant
structural characteristics and chemistry-based responses, inviting leveraging of both traditional
and advanced capabilities in machine learning. We discuss opportunities and challenges
associated with acquisition, processing, and analysis of multi-year data acquired at the
Agronomy Center for Research and Education (ACRE) at Purdue University, USA. Examples
include detection/counting, multi-modality predictive modeling of more complex phenotypes,
and generalization of models across space/time.
