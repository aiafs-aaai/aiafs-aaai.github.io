**Estimating Quantiles: An Informative Path Planning Approach to Guide Physical Sampling**  
Marine scientists interested in studying natural phenomena or agricultural experts interested in crop health often take physical specimens for later analysis. The locations at which specimens are taken are typically specified by expert heuristics. Instead, we propose to choose locations for physical specimens suggested by a robot performing an informative path planning survey. The survey is designed to extract  locations that correspond to the quantile values of some distribution of interest. We develop a robot planner using novel objective functions to improve the estimates of the quantile values over time and an approach to find locations which correspond to the quantile values. We demonstrate our approach on two different environments in simulation using previously collected aquatic data and validate it in a field trial that simulates some aspects of a crop health monitoring task. Our proposed approach to estimate quantiles has a 10.2% mean reduction in median error when compared to a baseline approach which attempts to maximize spatial coverage and is able to localize these values
